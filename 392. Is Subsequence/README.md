# 392. Is Subsequence

### Easy

---

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.\

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

## Example 1:

<pre>
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
</pre>

## Example 2:

<pre>
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
</pre>

## Constraints:

- 0 <= s.length <= 100
- 0 <= t.length <= 10^4
- s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
