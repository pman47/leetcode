# 647. Palindromic Substrings

### Medium

---

Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.

A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

## Example 1:

<pre>
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
</pre>

## Example 2:

<pre>
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
</pre>

## Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 1000
- s consists of lowercase English letters.
