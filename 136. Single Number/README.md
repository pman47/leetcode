# 136. Single Number

### Easy

---

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.\
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

## Example 1:

<pre>
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
</pre>

## Example 2:

<pre>
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
</pre>

## Example 3:

<pre>
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
</pre>

## Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 \* 10^4
- -3 _ 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 _ 10^4
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
