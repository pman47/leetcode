# 100. Same Tree

### easy

---

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

## Example 1:

<pre>
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
</pre>

## Example 2:

<pre>
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
</pre>

## Example 3:

<pre>
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
</pre>

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
- -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
