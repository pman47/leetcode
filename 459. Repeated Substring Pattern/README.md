# 459. Repeated Substring Pattern

### Easy

---

Given a string s, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together.

## Example 1:

<pre>
Input: s = "abab"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "ab" twice.
</pre>

## Example 2:

<pre>
Input: s = "aba"
Output: false
</pre>

## Example 3:

<pre>
Input: s = "abcabcabcabc"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "abc" four times or the substring "abcabc" twice.
</pre>

## Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
- s consists of lowercase English letters.
