# 69. Sqrt(x)

### Easy

---

- Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.
- Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.
- Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as pow(x, 0.5) or x \*\* 0.5.

## Example 1:

<pre>
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
</pre>

## Example 2:

<pre>
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
</pre>

## Constraints:

- 0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
